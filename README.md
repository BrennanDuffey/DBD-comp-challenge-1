<h1> Static Comp 1 </h1>
<p>This projects focus was to make clean CSS and HTML, and not using grid but flex-box for any styling with position. In addition practiced hoverstates and media queries to make the site dynamic for both smaller screens and mobile. Overall I like how the page responds on different screens and on mobile.</p>
